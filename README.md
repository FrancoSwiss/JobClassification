# Classify Job Postings

This project wants to classify job postings. Tensorflow, Colab Jupiter notebooks, Keras and many other developments in machine learning will make it possible to classify job postings.

The content of a job advertisement should be sufficient to decide whether it is a job for a student, an intern, a manager or a freelancer.

We want to predict a category for the occupational field. For example, we want to know whether it is a technical profession or a sales job. 

This repository is the place for ideas and working together.

Everyone is invited
